Please find attached, the java files for SP0
HeapSort.java and MergeSort.java

The running times of these algorithms were tested with a million numbers in descending order.
It seems that HeapSort using priority queue is almost twice as fast as MergeSort.
The running times averaged over 4 runs were 239 and 452 for heapSort and MergeSort respectively.
